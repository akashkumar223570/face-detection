# face-detection
ðŸš€ Project Completed: Face Detection Using OpenCV and Python ðŸš€  Iâ€™m excited to share my latest project â€” a Face Detection System developed using Python and OpenCV! In this project, I built a system capable of detecting faces in real-time through a webcam or from static images, using Haar Cascade Classifiers provided by OpenCV. ðŸ“¸âœ¨
